# Foreword:
This repo contains all of the projects made while properly learning NextJS.
 Unlike my Typescript and C++ repos, my notes are in the form of screen shots of the slides detailing what is being learned and discussed.
 Rarely will I have commented notes in this, Since a lot of my ReactJS knowledge carries over.
